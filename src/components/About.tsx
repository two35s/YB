                <strong>{site.owner}</strong> — developer and security-minded
                builder from Morocco. Y/B started from a simple irritation: the
                web is full of beautiful sites that leak data, and bulletproof
                systems nobody wants to use.

                <strong>built like a product and audited like a target</strong>{" "}
                — performance budgets, threat models, and typography all get
                the same obsession.
